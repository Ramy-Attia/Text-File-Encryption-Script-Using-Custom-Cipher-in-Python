# Text-File-Encryption-Script-Using-Custom-Cipher-in-Python
This Python script encrypts text from an input file using a predefined substitution cipher (encryption dictionary). The encrypted text is then written to a new output file. The encryption uses a custom key provided in the dictionary, where characters are substituted for other specific characters. The script ensures that file paths are valid before proceeding with the encryption process.

Features:
Custom encryption algorithm using a predefined substitution cipher.
Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as symbols and digits.
Reads from an input text file, encrypts the content, and writes it to an output text file.
Verifies the existence of the input file and handles spaces and newline characters correctly.
How to use:
Run the script.
Enter the name of the input file (including the extension) containing the text you want to encrypt.
Enter the name of the output file (including the extension) where you want the encrypted content to be saved.
The script will encrypt the content and store the result in the specified output file.

Example:
If you input a file input.txt containing the text:
Hello World!
And specify output.txt as the output file, the script will write the encrypted version of that text to output.txt based on the custom cipher defined in the program.
Encrypted output:
#6yyv Nvs7J
